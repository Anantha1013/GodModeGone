There are 100 pirates. They have 10,000 gold pieces. These pirates are ranked from most fearsome (1) to least fearsome (100). To divide the gold, the most fearsome pirate comes up with a method (e.g. split it evenly, or I get half and the second most fearsome gets the other half). The pirates then vote on this plan. If 50% or more vote in favor of the plan, then that is how the gold is divided. If >50% vote against the plan, the most fearsome pirate is killed and the next most fearsome comes up with a plan, etc. The pirates are perfectly rational. The pirates are perfectly rational. Yes, I said that twice - it is important. You are the most fearsome pirate. How much gold can you get without being killed?
